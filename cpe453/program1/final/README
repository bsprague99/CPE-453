These threads created from my library are classified as user threads, and
dont have access to OS level operations. OS threads have features like
synchronization, which my user threads have no synchronization between
serveral tasks. Also a user level threading lib runs only ina single process.
One way you could improve the library is add a more advanced scheduling
algorithm. In a real world application you would want error and exception
handling to prevent system crashes and ensure better stability.

Instructions:

make fib
./fib

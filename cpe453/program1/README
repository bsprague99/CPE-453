These threads created from my library are classified as user threads, and
dont have access to OS level operations. OS threads have features like
synchronization, which my user threads have no synchronization between
serveral tasks. Also a user level threading lib runs only ina single process.
One way you could improve the library is add a more advanced scheduling
algorithm. In a real world application you would want error and exception
handling to prevent system crashes and ensure better stability.

Instructions:

make fib
./fib


To future students:
I have two different pieces of advice:

1. With a pen and paper, or an ipad, make sure to write out stack frames,
as well as the structure of what the inital stack will look like during
initial stack creation. This will drastically help you when degugging with gdb
(this leads into my next point)


2. This needs to be said, because my go to debugging tool is print("here") as
im sure is the case for many, but get familiar with gdb. But not just basic gdb
from prog 0, but look up the gdb command cheatsheet that show memory and stack
information.

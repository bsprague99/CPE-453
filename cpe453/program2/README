Instructions to run schedSim (example cmds):

./schedSim jobs.txt -p FIFO
./schedSim jobs.txt -p RR -q 4
./schedSim jobs.txt -p SRTN

Questions:

1. For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?

    A: Workloads where all jobs have the same burst time, SRTN will deliver the same turnaround 
    times as FIFO because there is no advantage to preemption. 

2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same
    response times as RR?

    A: Workloads where yhe burst times of all processes should be shorter than the time quantum used in RR.

3. What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the
simulator to demonstrate the trend?

    A: As job lengths increase, the response time also increases. 

    input:
        100 20
        200 20
        500 40
        800 50

    output:
        Job   0 -- Turnaround 100.00 Wait 0.00
        Job   1 -- Turnaround 299.00 Wait 99.00
        Job   2 -- Turnaround 798.00 Wait 298.00
        Job   3 -- Turnaround 1597.00 Wait 797.00
        Average -- Turnaround 700.00 Wait 298.50

4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write
an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?

    A: As quantum length increases, the response time will increase as well. This is because
    Longer q time means jobs can run for longer without being interrupted.
    This would look like: response_time = (N - 1) * q
